In order for Part 3 to work, Please follow the steps below

Step 1
Compile Prcs_P1.c and name it Prcs_P1.exe
Compile Prcs_P2.c and name it Prcs_P2.exe

Step 2
Compile Parent_Prcs.c and name it what ever you want 

Step 3
Run the Parent file that you named and it should execute Process1 and Process2 one after the other.

That should be it, Thank you Arun!
